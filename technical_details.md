## Backend

In its backend, the website uses [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), which is a cloud database that handles our account and post collections. MongoDB atlas offers various cloud service providers, but we will use the [AWS(Amazon Web Services)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/) provider. We will also be using [JWT-authentication](https://jwt.io/introduction) in our program for our account authorization.

## Frontend

In its frontend, the website uses [Bootstrap 5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) to create a good-looking responsive webpage. We will use [Angular](https://angular.io/), a component-based framework using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which handles the UI/UX of our webpage.

## Development Tools

This website will be developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) using [Node Package Manager(npm)](https://docs.npmjs.com/).
