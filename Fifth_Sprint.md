### User Stories to be completed:
1. As a developer, I want to make the search case insensitive, so that students can search for the friends usernames without worrying about case
2. As a developer, I want to change the time format, so that all post dates and comment dates are in EST format
3. As a student, I want to delete my comments, so that I can delete any comments I've made on posts
4. As a student, I want to see my posts on my profile, so that I can see all the posts that i've posted myself
