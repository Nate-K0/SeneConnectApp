# SeneConnect Social Media App Project

This project aims at creating a social media web application where students can stay connected with one another, allowing them to create/login to an account, follow other accounts, like, dislike, comment on posts, and create or delete a post.

This service will be created using Node.js which will be supported by a MongoDB atlas database for student accounts and posts information, serving as the backend. We will also implement JWT auth0-based authentication to handle the login and registration of every account. In the frontend, we will use Angular (TypeScript) for the UI/UX functionality and Bootstrap(CSS) and CSS for the page design.

We prefer sharing the tasks as a group instead of splitting the work amongst each group member. This mitigates the issue of delays and fixing bugs or other problems later than anticipated.
