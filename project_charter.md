# Social Media Website

## 1. Introduction

This project aims at creating a social media web application where people can stay connected with one another, allowing users to create/login to an account, follow other users via a search bar on a search page, like, dislike, comment on posts, and create or delete a post on the home page. We're also going to be creating an account page where it shows the users account details such as their profile picture, name, and bio that they can edit.
