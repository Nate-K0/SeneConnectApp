Great work!

## Task 3

### Use Cases
- **Create a new Post (Tom Schwartz)** - Great 9/10 - The first postcondition is not really related to this use case -1
- **Creating Account (by Nathan Kenopic)** - Perfect 10/10
- **Search for User (Tony Deleanu)** - Perfect 10/10

### Milestones and Deliverables (8/10)
- For tools (functionalities), their design and testing should be under milestones. Then, when they become available to the end-user, they become deliverables.

## Task 4

### Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints (5/5)
Perfect!

### README.md (5/5)
No changes requested

### Use Cases
- **Delete a post (Tom Schwartz)** - (8/10) The system respons to the user's actions seems to be wrong. My hunch is that you used create_new_post as a basis (which is totally fine), but forgot to change those items. -2 You talk about the user entering confirmation numbers, but forgot to mention where these numbers were first presented. I asusme they were in the wrong system responses (no further deduction)
- **Edit User Profile (Tony Deleanu)** - Perfect 10/10
- **Comment On Post (by Nathan Kenopic)** -Almost Perfect 9/10 - Postcondition should mention that the comment is stored in the database.
